"""A Meridian plugin, as `meridian plugin new` writes one.

It connects to the sidecar it is launched beside, says who it was launched as
and what the deployment lets it do, reports itself healthy, and runs until it
is stopped. Heartbeats are sent for it.

Everything a plugin does goes through that sidecar. It holds no credential,
knows no other address, and cannot choose its own identity or grants: those
come from how the deployment launched it. Start from here -- the typed
operations on `plugin` are the steps its roles may take, and nothing else
reaches the bus -- and keep it that way.
